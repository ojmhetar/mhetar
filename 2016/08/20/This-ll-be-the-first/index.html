		 	<p>So, I guess I started a blog. Why? I’m not entirely sure. I can tell you, though, it’s not because I’m some expert who has a whole lot to share about the secrets of quantum computing or a master chef with tips on gourmet cusine. This’ll be the first of many post where I just share some of my thoughts, decisions, and progress. Progress of what? Perhpas the person I’d like to become. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’m going to spare you the intro of the life/history/tales of Ojas Mhetar (for now). Recently, I’ve had a lot of stuff on my mind and I just need a place to dump this heaping mess. Forgive me if my thoughts come out garjumbled and unorganized. So, I’m not going to share this with too many people initially (if any, to be honest); if you are reading this, let me know what you think. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Hm. Let’s try to keep this one short. Where to start?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I finished my undergrad a few months ago, in May. Its August now. I say “undergad” like I’m trying to keep the idea of graduate school alive, a thought I completed rejected while in school. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I moved to the Bay area in June. I had interned here before, but this time was completely different. The first week in the area, and at my new job, felt completely uncomfortable. It was a truly foreign feeling and I felt constrained. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I couldn’t grasp this idea of full-time, that I would be doing this for a year at least.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Everyday I felt like I had made a yuuuge mistake, that I shouldn’t have moved all the way across the country.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Even now, after two and a half months, I still feel the rollercoaster of content and misery. Which is really dumb. My life is great! I have a full time job, projected career growth, a fantastic degree, wow, I am truly grateful. So then, why did I, why do I stuggle and feel like I need to escape this situation?? I’m so eternely grateful for all the people, my parents, my friends who have given me the tools and support to build this foundation. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>So. Whats the problem?<br><br></p>
<p>I don’t know. The simple answer is I’m not where I want to be, yet. I haven’t become the person I want to be. Yet. I have a lot of thoughts, but I try not stay trapped inside these thoughts. </p>
<p><br><br>In the last two months, I have tried to “measure” the progress to what I want to become. This has helped me greatly and eased my mind by a ton. In my future posts, I’ll describe not only what I’ve been doing, but how/why as well as other reflections. I sincerly thank you for reading!</p>
