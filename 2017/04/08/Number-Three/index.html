		 	<p>I’ve tried to write a new post a couple times now, but I couldn’t find the right “voice.” I felt like I was writting for a “how-to” perspective and that wasn’t my intention. I just wanted to be able to share life updates as well as some perspective. Sorry for the wait! Hopefully I can get this one out. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In my last post, I said I was focused on growing three areas: Creativity, Health/Fitness, and Technical. Well, since it has been quite a while, I can tell you that I’ve been moving in the right direction. </p>
<p><br> My creative outlet for a good amount of time was cooking. I enjoy the process and have gotten to the point where I’m fairly good at it!<br><br><br>My technical growth has mostly been at work; I got the chance to travel to help out in some installations which was a lot of fun. My greatest focus, however, has been in the health/fitness category where I have seen lots of progress. That’s what I want to talk about a little further.<br><br><br><br><br>I’ve lifted consistently for the last 4+ years (since the begining of college). I saw diminishing returns on lifting during this time, partly due to : inconsistent diet, misinformation, overtraining, and breaks.<br><br><br>Having a full time job gives you a consistent schedule, so I wanted to use this to my advantage. I also was learning how to cook, so I could clean up my diet quite a bit as well.<br><br><br>In the last 4 months of 2016, getting more serious about my fitness, goals I decided to lean out a little bit. I was successful in what I wanted to achieve, so I wanted to contiue the trend into the next year.<br><br><br>I wanted to take it to the “next level”, so I found a powerlifting gym near me. I took a tour and I knew it was the place for me. The gym is owned by powerlifting world record holder Dan Green. Incredible guy. He’s helped me so much on my lifts and the over all atmosphere in the gym is what I’ve always wanted.<br><br><br>I’ve been at this gym, called Boss Barbell, since January now. I’ve seen a ton of growth on my lifts. When everyone is lifting 2x,3x,4x more than you, you really push your limits. I’ve been eating well, tracking intake through myFitnessPal. I’m stronger now than I’ve ever been with no pain/no injuries and it feels great!<br><br><br>I’m really excited about my progress!<br><br><br><br><br>So, I also got a new camera, will be posting new content soon.<br><br><br><br><br>Thanks,<br>–Os</p>
